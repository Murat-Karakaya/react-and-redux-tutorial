# React and Redux example

This is a simple example website that uses redux and react to make a counter app. Unlike a generic counter app tough: 
1. Inside the code you can find notes and recommendations.
2. This app uses both hook and class components to use redux. So you can learn both
3. It provides you with some sources for you to check it out

I will try to make class-only and hook-only branches if the number of likes for this repo reaches: 5. So you can have a clearer picture

I will try to add a step by step guide if this repo reaches 7 likes.

If you have a recommendation, open an issue. I will gladly respond to it.
